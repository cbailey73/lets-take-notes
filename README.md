# Note Taking Application

## Description
This project was developed for the purpose of providing users an easy way to write and save notes, and to access stored notes. This is accomplished by running an html page containing an input form, which allows the user to input the title and text content of their note.

Once they submit their note, its contents are routed to an internal database via a POST request to a server. The website, by continuously running GET requests to the server, then accesses and displays all notes saved to the server to the left of the input form. Users are also able to delete the notes they have previously saved, if they wish to clear up notes they feel they no longer need.

## Usage
On the main webpage, click the button labeled "Get Started". This will take you to the note taking application.

There, you will see the titles of previously saved notes arranged in a list on the left side of the page. Click on a title to view its note's text content. To write a new note, type the title you wish to give it into the text entry box labeled "Note Title." Then, enter the contents of your note into the box labeled "Note Text".

NOTE: The note taking application will not function properly unless the server is running. If you are having trouble saving, retrieving, or deleting notes, please refer to the following section.

## Troubleshooting
If the webpage is not able to save and display notes, it is likely that the server is not running. To start the server, clone this project's code, then navigate to the terminal of "server.js". Type "npm start" into the terminal to run the server. If successful, the terminal will display a link to the webpage. 

If the server still won't run, or if it is running and then webpage is still not functioning correctly, there is most likely a bug in the code. Feel free to shoot me an email [here](mailto:c73bailey@gmail.com) and I will do my best to fix it.
